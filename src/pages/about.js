              Hi, I'm T.J. Reid founder of Mr. Fix It LLC. I have been working in construction since 2000 
              and have over 20 years of experience! I strive to make my clients happy and would love to 
              help make your renovation or project a reality.

            <p>If you would like to make you project a reality please don't hesitate to contact me for a free estimate and let's talk about how I can help you.</p>
